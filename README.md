A C# program that produces a graphical output. Drawing a curve using a given math
equations of that curve. Drawing a function that graphs a fascinating shape such as a
flower, figure-eights, hearts, snow flakes, spirals, diamonds, and other amazing patterns.

This program teaches.
1. The C# coordinate system and Math coordinate system.
2. Conversion between C# coordinates and Math coordinates.
3. The scale factor that relates the two types of coordinates.
4. Equations in polar coordinates; equations in rectangular coordinates.
5. How to add consant to the current image without destroying the existing content.

The program will have a UI that display a panel structure of buttons (Start, Pause/Resume/ Exit).
It also displays the X and Y coordinates values showned in mathematical coordiantes of the point
of the ball pen as it draws the curve.
